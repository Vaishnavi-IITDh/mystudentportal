The above repository contains 2 different frameworks folders used to implement leave_management_system for students

                         ---- Used MongoDB , Express.js , Node.js , JWT for backend


2. MyProject             ---- Used html,css, javascript as frontend
                         ---- Used C# , .NET , Azure Web App as backend

   (admin (1).html)       -- admin view for viewing all the submitted students leave requests and they can approve/disapprove the pending reuqests .
                          -- we thought of removing the edit option to adin after 2-3 approve/disapprovels that too until the time of that leave_request startTime ( He can approve/disapprove) but wasn't able to                                  code due  to time constraints
   
   (index (1).html)       -- student view for submitting leave_requests with their studentId , startTime , endTime , reasonForLeave

   track_leave (1).html   -- student view for tracking the leave_requests given their studentId . Thougt of even adding the time at which the leave_requests was submitted . But wasn't able to do it .
